A task management program in PHP

WARNING: most functionality is currently broken.  I am githubifying my personal project in the middle of a rewrite.

I am changing it from a flat php file format, i.e. poor programming practice, to a OOP design reminiscent of MVC.  Though at the time I started the rewrite I didn't know what MVC was.  I just wanted to enable good code reuse.
